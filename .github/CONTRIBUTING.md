There are a few ways in which you can contribute to the documentation. Open an issue if you are unsure that your pull request is appropriate.

Many pull requests we get are for simple typos and clarifications. These are great! Some PRs add a snippet of info that makes the tutorial much smoother for the user. These are especially useful because they do away with an assumption of knowledge we have made. 

For typo fixes, please describe the typo that was fixed **in your commit message**.

If you'd like to request a tutorial or even contribute one, feel free to open an issue for discussion first!
